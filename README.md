This is a simple chat application that was inspired by Barney Stinson's "Lemon Law" from the show: "How I met your Mother" which states that only 5 minutes is needed to get to know someone well enough to decide if you would want to date him/her.   


People who use this application are automatically placed into chat rooms of maximum 2 occupancy. They are then given
5 minutes to talk to each other and decide whether or not they would like to exchange contact information with the other person. After 5 minutes
is up, they are both kicked out of the room and can re-enter the application to meet someone new.
